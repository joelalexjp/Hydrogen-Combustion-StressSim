# Hydrogen-Combustion-StressSim
FEM simulation of a hydrogen combustion chamber under thermal and pressure loads.
# Hydrogen Combustion Chamber – Stress Simulation

## 🔍 Objective

To simulate thermal and pressure stress in a hydrogen internal combustion engine (ICE) combustion chamber using FEM techniques.

## 🛠 Tools & Methods

- CAD: SolidWorks or Fusion 360
- FEM: ANSYS or Fusion FEA
- Post-processing: Excel or Python (matplotlib)

## 🧪 Simulation Goals

- Model geometry of a simplified hydrogen ICE combustion chamber
- Apply realistic pressure and temperature boundary conditions
- Run static and thermal stress analysis
- Evaluate material performance under hydrogen combustion conditions
